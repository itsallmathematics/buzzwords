# list of tech buzzwords

> A buzzword is a word or phrase, new or already existing, that becomes popular for a period of time. Buzzwords often derive from technical terms yet often have much of the original technical meaning removed through fashionable use, being simply used to impress others.
> - Wikipedia

This repository aims to house a comprehensive list of current (and eventually, past) buzzwords in the "tech" industry. Could be used to seed buzzword bingo, mad libs, etc... There is no requirement for word popularity, but there is a requirement that someone aside from you has used the term.

Examples: cloud, service, service fabric, service mesh, cloud-native, multi-tenant, microservice, etc...
